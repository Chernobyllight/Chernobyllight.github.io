Hi! I am currently in my third year of pursuing a master degree at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). My advisors are [Yulan Guo](https://www.yulanguo.cn/) and [Longguang Wang](https://longguangwang.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree from the School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2023.

My current research interests include low-level vision, specifically image/video restoration, as well as image/video style transfer. Besides, I have extensive experience in image/video generation and editing.
